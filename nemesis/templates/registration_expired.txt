Subject:User account expired!
Hello {name},

This is to let you know that your Student Robotics user account has not
been activated in time and has therefore expired.

If you still want to have a Student Robotics user account you now need to
talk to your team leader, and ask them to re-register you.

Thanks,

The Student Robotics Team
