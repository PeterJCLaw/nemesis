Subject:Reset your Student Robotics account password
Hello {name},

{requestor_name} has requested a password reset for your Student Robotics
account.

To reset your password, please click (or copy/paste into a browser) this link:

	{password_reset_url}

This is a one-time-use link, and is only valid for the next {password_reset_days} days,

If you weren't expected this you should probably talk to the person who
requested the reset about it. In the mean-time your account is unchanged
and you can continue using it as normal.

Thanks,

The Student Robotics Team
