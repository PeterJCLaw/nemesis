Subject:User account request expired!
Hello {name},

This is to let you know that the account you requested for {pu_first_name} {pu_last_name}
has not been activated, and the request has now expired. If you still
want {pu_first_name} {pu_last_name} to have a Student Robotics account
unfortunately you will now need to re-register them.

Thanks,

The Student Robotics Team
