Subject:Activate your Student Robotics user account
Hello {name},

Your team-leader has registered you for a shiny new Student Robotics account.

Once activated, this will let you access the Student Robotics facilities,
including the forums and the software development environment for your robot.

To activate your account, please click (or copy/paste into a browser) this
link, which will also let you set your password:

	{activation_url}

This is a one-time-use link, and is only valid for the next {activation_days} days,

If you fail to activate your account in time, it will be removed and you'll
need to ask your team-leader to re-register you.

Thanks,

The Student Robotics Team
